* This is a static site — no backend or database used.
* I used [Lightbox2](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) for the pop-up image view.
* The artworks displayed are **my own creations**, both digital and scanned hand-drawn pieces.
* You can klik the link ( a public website ) in the about page on the side bar of this repo
